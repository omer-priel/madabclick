  "section-2-body": "The 'Science in a Click' website was established during the difficult days of the swords Of Iron War, which highlighted the importance of having a platform for curious children, in this period and beyond. Here, you will find easy and fun video clips of scientific content that are both enjoyable and enriching. This initiative was founded by a group of young Ascola Alumni Network members, who loved watching scientific videos throughout their childhood, which prompted them to devote efforts to compiling selected video clips for you, the future generation of scientists. These video clips do not replace the official educational curriculum, but rather add another fun and interesting aspect to the traditional education experience.",
